# zellostream
Python script to stream audio one way to a Zello channel.  Designed for Python 3.X

For Zello consumer network:
- Go to https://developers.zello.com/ and click Login
- Enter your Zello username and password. If you don't have Zello account download Zello app and create one.
- Complete all fields in the developer profile and click Submit
- Click Keys and Add Key
- Copy and save Sample Development Token, Issuer, and Private Key. Make sure you copy each of the values completely using Select All.
- Click Close
- Copy the Private Key into a file called privatekey.pem that's in the same folder as the script.
- The Issuer value goes into config.json.
